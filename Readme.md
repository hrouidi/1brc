# 1️⃣🐝🏎️ The One Billion Row Challenge

.NET implementation of https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc

> If you want to compare results on the same hardware, open a PR with your implementation. Add it to a directory `1brc_githugusername`. This directory must contain a dotnet project `1brc.csproj` (not renamed) and your code. You program must accept the first argument as the path to the measurements file.
>
> This should work from the repo dir:
> dotnet build 1brc_githugusername/1brc.csproj -c Release
> dotnet run --project 1brc_githugusername/1brc.csproj -c Release --no-build -- path/to/the/file.txt


Note that his implementation supports `\r\n` line endings. The numbers in the Evolution section below are from Windows, where the input file is 13.7GB vs 12.8GB. It's generated by the upstream Java code on Windows so this is an implicit requirement for x-plat already.

## Results

> The performance is measured on an idle 6C/12T Alder Lake CPU fixed at 2.5 GHz (no turbo), 32GB DDR4 3200, Debian 12 in LXC. At least 5 runs, showing the best result.
> 
> Note: results are very stable, usually only the 2nd decimal changes between the runs.

> \* On my machine 1 and 2 places are swapped for Java. The best number is shown in the table instead of an average. However the individual results overlap a lot in a tight range. Therefore I believe it's a tie.

## Evolution

Below is the evolution of results with each commit. The time shown here is measured inside the app, on Windows. Not comparable with `time` command (startup/shutdown time is not measured). 

#### First attempt

Mmap + paralell using Span API and some unsafe tricks to avoid Utf8 parsing until the very end.

#### Some micro optimizations

```
Processed in 00:00:09.7093471
```

Float parsing is ~57%, dictionary lookup is ~24%. Optimizing further is about those two things. We may use `csFastFloat` library and a specialized dictionary such as `DictionarySlim`. However the goal is to avoid dependencies even if they are pure .NET.

It's near-perfectly parallelizable though. On 8 cores it should be 33% faster than on 6 that I have. With 32GB RAM the file should be cached by an OS after the first read. The first read may be very slow in the cloud VM, but then the cache should eliminate the difference between drive speeds.


#### Use naive double parsing

If we can assume that the float values are well formed then the speed almost doubles.

#### Optimized double parsing with fallback

No assumptions are required if we fallback to the full .NET parsing implementation on any irregularity.

#### Optimize hash function

#### Use specification to use int parsing and branchless min/max

#### Set dictionary capacity

Set dictionary capacity to 10k.

```
`\n` only
Processed in 00:00:03.2530659

`\r\n`

Processed in 00:00:03.3641962
Processed in 00:00:03.3762491
```


#### Manual SIMD: find boundaries and simplify parsing

Use AVX2-optimized `IndexOf`.

Find boundaries for `;`, `.` and `\n`.

Optimize/simplify int parsing between `;`and `.` and use a single digit that is always after `.`.

```
Processed in 00:00:03.0687066
Processed in 00:00:03.0819551
```

#### Use int16 for min/max in Summary

Struct size is 16 👌


#### Avoid zero extension, optimize locals & loop

Avoid possible zero extension overhead in ParseInt and Hash, optimize ParseInt locals & loop

Extending `short => int` is more expensive than `short => ushort => uint => int` if all numbers are positive.

ParseInt loop was not good

#### Optimize IndexOf

The initial implementation was lazy with more operations than needed
